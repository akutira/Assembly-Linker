Loop through Text 1 while having relocation table 1 on stand by. Going line by line if there is a modification of 
the text line im currently on (with lw or sw) in the data section then resolve that issue using these methods:
	1. If its a local variable then you have to add the length of the other text files and preceeding data 
	to the offset.
	2. If its a global variable then loop through and find which symbol table has that variable 
	then take that number listed and add it with the text's size at and preceeding + data preceeding
Move on to next text until there aren't anymore texts.
Loop through Data 1 while having relocation table 1 on stand by. Going line by line if there is a modification of
the data line im currently on (with .fill) in the data section then resolve that issue using these methods
	1. If its a local variable then you have to see if the data number is less than the text length
	if it is (meaning its in text) then add it with the preceeding text. If it isn't (meaning its in data)
	then add preceeding text and preceeding data
	2. If its a global variable then loop through and find which symbol table has that variable 
	then take that number listed and add it with the data's size at and preceeding + data preceeding
Move on to next text until there aren't anymore datas.
